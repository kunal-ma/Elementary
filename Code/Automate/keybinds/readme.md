Keybinds Manager
======

AutoHotKey script designed to maximise user efficiency and provide convenient access to essential functions via custom keybinds. It runs in the background, and works on less than 5 MB of RAM. Moreover, it does not interfere with any anti-cheat programs, such as VAC and Vanguard, so it is safe for use in any system.

Note : Some apps need shortcut links in a separate folder (./Shortcuts) to work properly.
